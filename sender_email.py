    Dear Sir/Ma'am,

    Please find the required documents below for the Python (Selenium) assignment:

    1. Screenshot of the form filled via code .
    2. Source code (GitHub repository):  https://github.com/KrishnakumarModi/Auto_fill_Form
    3. Your resume.
    4. Links to past projects/work samples:  https://github.com/KrishnakumarModi
    5. Brief documentation of your approach:
        Setup:
        Use Selenium to automate the browser and interact with the Google Form.
        Install necessary libraries, such as Selenium and WebDriver for browser automation.

        Automating Google Form:
        Open the Google Form using Selenium.
        Fill in the form fields automatically (e.g., name, email, resume).
        Submit the form after all required fields are filled.

        Screenshot Capture:
        After filling the form, take a screenshot of the form using Seleniumâ€™s built-in screenshot functionality.

        Email Preparation:
        Use Python's smtplib to configure email settings.
        Compose an email with a clear subject and body, explaining the documents.
        Attach files: form screenshot, source code, documentation, resume, and project links.
        Email Sending:
        Send the email with all attachments using the configured SMTP server.

   
    6. Confirm your availability to work full time (10 am to 7 pm) for the next 3-6 months:
        Yes, I am available to work full-time from 10 AM to 7 PM for the next 3-6 months in a work-from-home setup.

    Best regards,
